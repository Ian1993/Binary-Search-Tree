Instructions:

	Follow onscreen prompts, all functions should work

Design Decisions:

       Reads a string, any string, as one unit, white space to white space,
       including punctuation and without compensating in any way for case.
       This was mainly due to time, and I felt it made a better showing of
       how a binary search tree works with strings given that "THE" and "the"
       are not the same to the computer.

       TEST.txt is a few pages of the Sherlock Holmes sample that was provided
       and can be used with the program.

       I appoligize about my lack of good documentation in my program, I ran
       out of time (having been forced to put this on the back burner for
       more immediate concerns until it was nearly too late and then suffering
       a series of setbacks with the program).

Errors

	None known.
